Supporting Material of Salces-Castellano et al. (2020) doi 10.1111/ele.13433
Custom R scripts created by Carmelo And√∫jar to apply a genetic divergence threshold on the phylogenetic tree and establish LMDH and PBS

Script 1 - To apply without previous information and establish de novo LMDH and PBS
Script 2 - To apply considering previous established LMDH or PBS

Instrucctions:
Run the EXECUTION script, which calls the FUNCTION script. The global alignment of parataxonomic units (PU) is needed.
