Custom R scripts created by Carmelo And√∫jar to apply a maximum intraspecific divergence threshold on the phylogenetic tree, and define lineages of maternal dispersal history (LMDH) and presumed biological species (PBS).

Script 1 - For applying without previous information, to define de novo LMDH and PBS.

Script 2 - For applying with previous defined LMDH or PBS.

Instrucctions:

Run the EXECUTION script, which calls the FUNCTION script. The complete alignment of parataxonomic units (PU) with a code "XX + number" is required.
